procyclingstats package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Procyclingstats is a package for scraping https://www.procyclingstats.com/.
Interface consists from scraping classes which are currently Race,
RaceStartlist, Ranking, Rider, RiderResults, Stage and Team.

Basic Rider class usage:
    >>> from procyclingstats import Rider
    >>> rider = Rider("rider/tadej-pogacar")
    >>> rider.birthdate()
    "1998-9-21"
    >>> rider.parse()
    {
        'birthdate': '1998-9-21',
        'height': 1.76,
        'name': 'Tadej  Pogaƒçar',
        'nationality': 'SI',
        ...
    }

Usage of all scraping classes is almost the same and the only difference among
them are parsing method as is for example `birthdate` in Rider usage example.
